# eon-timeline

> A flexible events timeline library.

## What it is

eon-timeline is a tool to visualize events in a timeline. It aims for **flexibility**, so based on a time range, it focuses on determining which events should be visible (using a date range as a reference), and the position it should have in this range. How you want to represent it, depends entirely on what you need. That flexibility is powered by a ["layer" approach](./layers.md).

If you're also looking for a prebuilt implementation, I got you. By default, provides a React (`>= v15`) component. Vue and Svelte are in the roadmap, you can contribute with other implementations.

See the [Quick start](quickstart.md) guide for more details.

## Features

- Flexibly by default.
- Simple API to fit your needs.
- DOM layer is responsive and support touch events.
